# Overview of Convex Hull
A [Convex Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) takes in A set P of n points in 2-dimensional space **(Input)** and it finds the smallest convex polygon containing all of the points of set P **(Solution)**

***This Repository Contains***
1. Implementation of Graham's Scan
2. Implementation of Jarvis' March/Gift Wrapping 
3. Python script to randomly generate a set of 2-dimensional points
4. Output files

***Output files which each contain (broken into a separate section for each algorithm)***
- The number of elements the algorithm performed on
- The time elapsed to run the algorithm
- The hull points (coordinate pairs that are apart of the Convex Hull)

***Instructions Running***
- No command line arguments are necessary
- Run the Python script included to generate 10 different random datasets of 2-dimensional points
- Add the files produced from the Python script to your IED
- Update any file or folder names in main.cpp as necessary and run
